Extremely basic server implementation I made to test out the Java HttpServer class. Uses [exchange-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api) to have some data to work with.

Needs Java and Maven.

Build:
`mvn clean package`

Run:
`java -jar target/basic-java-server-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
